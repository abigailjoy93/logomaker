# logomaker

This application was developed with the intention to create a general logo based on 4 criteria prompts.

# Installation

Before using the application, please run 'npm i'

# Usage

Upon running the logo.js via node on the command line, the user will be met with four prompts:

? Please enter up to three letters you would like displayed on your logo.

? Please enter a color keyword or six-digit hexidecimal code (including the #) for the desired color of the text.

? What shape would you like your logo to be?

? Please enter a color keyword or the six-digit hexidecimal code (including the #) for the desired color of the shape.

The answers to the prompts are then fed into the code which generates an .svg file with a generic logo based of the criteria provided.
